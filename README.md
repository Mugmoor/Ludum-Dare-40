This game is not currently licensed, though this will change in the future.

SNOW GROW is a simple run-based game where you play as a simple snowball who wants nothing more than to bring a White Christmas to the 
village below his mountain.

Your goal is to roll down the hill, growing in size as you do, and cause as much havoc on the town as possible at the end. How much damage 
you cause is directly rlated to your velocity, and size upon impact. These are affected by your run down the hill, hitting obstacles 
causes you to lose speed and some size.

So get out there, and GROW SOME SNOW.


Snow Grow uses Unity as the base engine, Blender for Modelling, and Audacity (with a LTD MH-400 Guitar and Rocksmith USB Cable) for music.
